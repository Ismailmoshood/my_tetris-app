Play Tetris [TETRIS](https://stellular-ganache-542817.netlify.app/)

I built this version of Tetris as a project for Qwasar Silicon Valley. It was a really fun way to learn about game architecture, while also focusing on the fundamentals of modern Javascript.

Using a template by Michael Kar√©n, I built this game on a canvas rendered as a grid - if the space is empty, the matrix is filled with a '0', else it is filled with a number representing the shape of the piece. The tetrominos are constructed around a center axis, 
and the matrix is transposed when the user roatates a piece. We use classes for the board and the tetrominos, and use a proxy object to help keep track of the score. In addition, I added ghost piece to show potential drop space and the ability to swap pieces in/out to a 'hold' box.
